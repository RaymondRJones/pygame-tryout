# Flappy Bird in pygame

# Running the Game
This is all python and pygame code so you can run it with

`pip install pygame`

`python flappy_bird.py`

# Summary

I decided to randomly try out pygame and see how it's functions and logic works. What better way than to recreate an popular game from like 2015.
